# Problem 4 - Remove Duplicates From An Array

* Number Four  of the six java coding challenges for beginners by Maersk for Sparta Global Academy.

Write a program to remove duplicates from an array in Java without using the Java Collection API. The array can be an array of String, Integer or Character, your solution should be independent of the type of array.

Please write the unit tests for your solution using any of the unit testing framework.

## Instructions to build and run the code

    1. Open the project in Intellij
    2. Navigate to the App.java file in the project explorer
    3. Run the main method

* Note: App.java can be found in Problem4_MaerskJavaTasks\RemoveDuplicates\src\main\java\com\spartaglobal\em\engineering50\App.java

* In main, the removeDuplicates() method accepts an array as an input and returns another array that does not include the duplicates.

## Platform limitations

* No notable limitations for Intellij.

## Dependencies

* JUnit 5.6.0 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api 

## Assumptions

* The array can be an array of String, Integer or Character and nothing else (so only those have been tested).

## Highlights

* 9 unit tests for each class.

* Code Coverage on RemoveDuplicates class: methods: 100% lines: 100%.

* Code Coverage on ArrayLength class: methods: 100% lines: 100%.

## Improvements

* could collect duplicates in a separate array
